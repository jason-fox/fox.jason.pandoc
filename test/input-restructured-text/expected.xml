    <title>Structure</title>
    <body>
      <p>From the outset, let me say that "Structured Text" is probably a bit
of a misnomer. It's more like "Relaxed Text" that uses certain
consistent patterns. These patterns are interpreted by a HTML
converter to produce "Very Structured Text" that can be used by a web
browser.</p>
      <p>The most basic pattern recognised is a
        <b>paragraph</b>(
        <xref format="html" href="quickref.html#paragraphs" scope="external">quickref</xref>).
That's a chunk of text that is separated by blank lines (one is
enough). Paragraphs must have the same indentation -- that is, line
up at their left edge. Paragraphs that start indented will result in
indented quote paragraphs. For example:</p>
      <codeblock>This is a paragraph.  It's quite
short.

   This paragraph will result in an indented block of
   text, typically used for quoting other text.

This is another one.</codeblock>
      <p>Results in:</p>
      <p>This is a paragraph. It's quite
short.</p>

    <body>
      <p>(
        <xref format="html" href="quickref.html#inline-markup" scope="external">quickref</xref>)</p>
      <p>Inside paragraphs and other bodies of text, you may additionally mark
text for
        <i>italics</i>with "
        <codeph>*italics*</codeph>" or
        <b>bold</b>with
"
        <codeph>**bold**</codeph>". This is called "inline markup".</p>
      <p>If you want something to appear as a fixed-space literal, use
"
        <codeph></codeph>double back-quotes
        <codeph></codeph>". Note that no further fiddling is done
inside the double back-quotes -- so asterisks "
        <codeph>*</codeph>" etc. are left
alone.</p>
      <p>If you find that you want to use one of the "special" characters in
text, it will generally be OK -- reStructuredText is pretty smart.
For example, this lone asterisk * is handled just fine, as is the
asterisk in this equation: 5*6=30. If you actually
want text *surrounded by asterisks* to
        <b>not</b>be italicised, then
you need to indicate that the asterisk is not special. You do this by
placing a backslash just before it, like so "
        <codeph>\*</codeph>" (
        <xref format="html" href="quickref.html#escaping" scope="external">quickref</xref>), or
by enclosing it in double back-quotes (inline literals), like this:</p>
      <codeblock>``*``</codeblock>
      <p>Tip</p>
      <note type="tip">
        <p>Think of inline markup as a form of (parentheses) and use it
the same way: immediately before and after the text being marked
up. Inline markup by itself (surrounded by whitespace) or in the
middle of a word won't be recognized. See the
          <xref format="html" href="../../ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#inline-markup" scope="external">markup spec</xref>for
full details.</p>

    <title>Lists</title>
    <body>
      <p>Lists of items come in three main flavours:
        <b>enumerated</b>,
        <b>bulleted</b>and
        <b>definitions</b>. In all list cases, you may have as
many paragraphs, sublists, etc. as you want, as long as the left-hand
side of the paragraph or whatever aligns with the first line of text
in the list item.</p>
      <p>Lists must always start a new paragraph -- that is, they must appear
after a blank line.</p>
      <p>__ quickref.html#enumerated-lists</p>
      <p>Start a line off with a number or letter followed by a period ".",
right bracket ")" or surrounded by brackets "( )" -- whatever you're
comfortable with. All of the following forms are recognised:</p>
      <codeblock>1. numbers

A. upper-case letters
   and it goes over many lines

   with two paragraphs and all!

a. lower-case letters

   3. with a sub-list starting at a different number
   4. make sure the numbers are in the correct sequence though!

I. upper-case roman numerals

i. lower-case roman numerals

(1) numbers again

1) and again</codeblock>
      <p>Results in (note: the different enumerated list styles are not
always supported by every web browser, so you may not get the full
effect here):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>numbers</li>
      </ol>
      <p>upper-case letters
and it goes over many lines</p>
      <p>with two paragraphs and all!</p>
      <ol>
        <li></li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>with a sub-list starting at a different number</li>
        <li>make sure the numbers are in the correct sequence though!</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>lower-case letters</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>upper-case roman numerals</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>lower-case roman numerals</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>numbers again</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>and again</li>
      </ol>
      <p>__ quickref.html#bullet-lists</p>
      <p>Just like enumerated lists, start the line off with a bullet point
character - either "-", "+" or "*":</p>
      <codeblock>* a bullet point using "*"

  - a sub-list using "-"

    + yet another sub-list

  - another item</codeblock>
      <p>Results in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>yet another sub-list</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>a sub-list using "-"</li>
        <li>another item</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>a bullet point using "*"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>__ quickref.html#definition-lists</p>
      <p>Unlike the other two, the definition lists consist of a term, and
the definition of that term. The format of a definition list is:</p>
      <codeblock>what
  Definition lists associate a term with a definition.

*how*
  The term is a one-line phrase, and the definition is one or more
  paragraphs or body elements, indented relative to the term.
  Blank lines are not allowed between term and definition.</codeblock>

      <p>To just include a chunk of preformatted, never-to-be-fiddled-with

block is finished when the text falls back to the same indentation
level as a paragraph prior to the preformatted block. For example:</p>

    Whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and all kinds of markup

      <p>(
        <xref format="html" href="../../ref/rst/directives.html#images" scope="external">quickref</xref>)</p>
      <p>To break longer text up into sections, you use
        <b>section headers</b>.
These are a single line of text (one or more words) with adornment: an
underline alone, or an underline and an overline together, in dashes
"
        <codeph>-----</codeph>", equals "
        <codeph>======</codeph>", tildes "
        <codeph>~~~~~~</codeph>" or any of the
non-alphanumeric characters
        <codeph>= - ` : ' " ~ ^ _ * + # &lt; &gt;</codeph>that you
feel comfortable with. An underline-only adornment is distinct from
an overline-and-underline adornment using the same character. The
underline/overline must be at least as long as the title text. Be
consistent, since all sections marked with the same adornment style
are deemed to be at the same level:</p>
      <codeblock>Chapter 1 Title
===============

Section 1.1 Title
-----------------

Subsection 1.1.1 Title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Section 1.2 Title
-----------------

Chapter 2 Title
===============</codeblock>
      <p>This results in the following structure, illustrated by simplified
pseudo-XML:</p>
      <codeblock>&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
        Chapter 1 Title
    &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;
            Section 1.1 Title
        &lt;section&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;
                Subsection 1.1.1 Title
    &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;
            Section 1.2 Title
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
        Chapter 2 Title</codeblock>
      <p>(Pseudo-XML uses indentation for nesting and has no end-tags. It's
not possible to show actual processed output, as in the other
examples, because sections cannot exist inside block quotes. For a
concrete example, compare the section structure of this document's
source text and processed output.)</p>
      <p>Note that section headers are available as link targets, just using
their name. To link to the
        <xref format="dita" href="#lists" type="topic">Lists</xref>heading, I write "
        <codeph>Lists_</codeph>". If
the heading has a space in it like
        <xref format="dita" href="#text-styles" type="topic">text styles</xref>, we need to quote
the heading "
        <codeph>`text styles`_</codeph>".</p>
    </body>
    <topic id="document-title-subtitle" specializations="@props/deliveryTarget">
      <title>Document Title / Subtitle</title>
      <body>
        <p>The title of the whole document is distinct from section titles and
may be formatted somewhat differently (e.g. the HTML writer by default
shows it as a centered heading).</p>
        <p>To indicate the document title in reStructuredText, use a unique adornment
style at the beginning of the document. To indicate the document subtitle,
use another unique adornment style immediately after the document title. For
example:</p>
        <codeblock>================
 Document Title
================
----------
 Subtitle
----------

Section Title
=============

...</codeblock>
        <p>Note that "Document Title" and "Section Title" above both use equals
signs, but are distict and unrelated styles. The text of
overline-and-underlined titles (but not underlined-only) may be inset
for aesthetics.</p>

the image (format, size etc). If the image is to appear in HTML and
